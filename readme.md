# Depression Prediction Model

## Overview
This project analyzes depression likelihood based on various factors such as age, marital status, education level, smoking status, physical activity, and more. It uses machine learning to assign a likelihood score indicating how likely an individual is to be depressed.

## **Getting Started**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alvishprasla11/All-is-well.git
cd All-is-well
```

### **2. Install Required Dependencies**
#### **For Windows/macOS/Linux**
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all necessary libraries.

## **Running the Django Application**
To start the Django web application:

### **1. Navigate to the Django Project Folder**
```bash
cd app
```

### **2. Apply Migrations**
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### **3. Run the Server**
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Now, the app should be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## **Model Information**
### **What the Model Does**
- Predicts depression likelihood based on provided input features.
- Uses machine learning algorithms to assign a probability score.
- The higher the score, the more likely an individual is to be depressed.

### **Where the Model is Stored**
The trained machine learning model is located at:
```
model/trained_model.pkl
```
It can be loaded using Python's `joblib` library:
```python
import joblib
model = joblib.load("model/trained_model.pkl")
prediction = model.predict([[25, 1, 2, 6.5, 7, 2, 3, 1, 0, 8, 30, 5, 1, 120, 200, 90]])
print("Predicted Depression Likelihood:", prediction)
```

---

## **Libraries & Dependencies**
All required libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`:
```
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
django
joblib
```
To install them, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **Data Files**
- **Original Data**: `data/original_data.csv`
- **Transformed Data** (Preprocessed): `data/transformed_data.csv`
- **Power BI File**: `powerbi/depression_analysis.pbix`

---

## **Next Steps**
- Improve accuracy by fine-tuning hyperparameters.
- Implement a better frontend for user interaction.
- Add more data to increase model robustness.
